\subsection{Design}

- summarizing chat text wont work, because the whole orchestration must be done with LLM
- chunking chat text wont work either -- neither RoundRobinGroupChat nor SelectorGroupChat allow that
- handing off like in swarm wont work either (really?), because also in swarm agents use the shared chat environment
- calling tools one after another from one agent isnt possible -- it make seemingly parallel calls to all selected tools, but can't pass data returned from one tool to another
