\section{Portfolio documentation}
\label{sec:documentation}

Compile a comprehensive documentation of your project, including all the project phases. You will need to explain every choice you made during the project and your thoughts about the results you get. You will introduce the results in suitable visualisation. Furthermore, you will need to explain which criteria you follow to build your prompts and how they affect the results. 

Students write the entire documentation with sections, sub-sections, diagrams, etc in this section. Please write as comprehensively as possible. Head to the document 1\_documentation.tex. You are free to use as many subsections as required. We will not provide a template for documentation.
