The framework divides each phase of development (design, coding, testing) into smaller subtasks and guides the agents in their communication and solution proposition. The unique aspect of ChatDev is the implementation of communicative dehallucination, which reduces coding hallucinations by encouraging agents to seek more specific information before generating a response.\n",

The proposed framework assigns specific Agile roles, such as Product Manager, Developer, and Tester, to different agents. This enables them to collaborate efficiently in incremental development through sprints.\\\\n\\\\n   A key component of AGILECODER is the Dynamic Code Graph Generator (DCGG), which creates a Code Dependency Graph dynamically as updates are made to the codebase. This allows agents to better comprehend complex software repositories, resulting in precise code generation and modifications. The agent roles, interactions, and the workflow follow an Agile building process, ensuring adaptability and iterative refinement of the developed software.\\\\n\\\\n   Experimental evaluations conducted on various datasets, including HumanEval, MBPP, and the newly proposed ProjectDev, demonstrate that AGILECODER outperforms existing benchmarks, such as ChatDev and MetaGPT, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Moreover, AGILECODER\\'s incorporation of Agile principles and the DCGG module makes it a significant advancement in software development automation, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability for advanced software engineering tasks.\\\\n\\\\n   In essence, AGILECODER offers a promising solution for software development teams seeking to effectively apply Agile Methodology in an advanced software engineering domain, while improving development efficiency and achieving high-quality results.\", \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 22082, \"completion_tokens\": 336}, \"cached\": false, \"logprobs\": null, \"thought\": null}', name='get_summary', call_id='call_v5bn', is_error=False)]\n",
