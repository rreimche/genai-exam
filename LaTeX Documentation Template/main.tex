%  !!!!! Remove the following (until before \medskip command) before submitting !!!! :)
All of the resources used by the student to complete the portfolio task should be organised in the references section. 
\textbf {Note that the Reference section does not count towards the number of pages of the report.} Example references are given below \cite{einstein}\cite{knuthwebsite}\cite{latexcompanion}. \textbf{ If you are using a reference manager like Zotero, you can export your Zotero library as a .bib file and use it on Overleaf. As you cite the article/technology/library in your main text, the References section will automatically update accordingly.} Please include a full list of references found. If students are using Zotero for their research paper management, a bibTeX will help them during citation which automatically adds references to the report.
